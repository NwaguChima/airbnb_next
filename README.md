## About Project

Airbnb_next is a remake of the airbnb website, with Nextjs, Typescript and SASS
Basically the project shows house listings available in various locations, with the ability to filter through various categories. The houses available are also displayed on map, to show their exact location on a map. The UI was built to fit all screen sizes as it is fully responsive, and the images were optimized.
